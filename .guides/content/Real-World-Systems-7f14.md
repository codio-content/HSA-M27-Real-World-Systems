Real-world systems can be modeled and simulated on a computer.  The simulation of a system allows computer scientists to explore and and study the system in ways that would not be possible by studying the real-world alone.

By simulating systems, we can explore how new or unexpected events might affect the population without actually putting any creatures in danger.  It is possible to determine the results of a food shortage or drought without subjecting anyone to hunger or pain.

We can also simulate hypothetical situations, what happens if a new disease is introduced to a group of people?
