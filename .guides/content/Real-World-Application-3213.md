For each contact with another person, you have a chance of becoming infected.
If the other person is infected, the parameter otherInfected will be True, False if they are not.
For each contact, there is a 70% chance of becoming infected if the other person was infected.
If the other person is not infected, there is still a 5% chance of infection.

Write the code that determines infection using the probabilities listed.

## Real-World Examples
For a long time, the only way to know what would happen was to look back at history or to create physical models.  The army corps of engineers actually created an enormous model of the Mississippi river basin to determine possible flooding based on different factors.  This was a very expensive and resource-intensive endeavor and has subsequently been replaced by computer modeling.
