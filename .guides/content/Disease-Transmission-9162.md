Create a Flode chart showing the operation of an app that simulates the spread of disease.  The app uses the GPS of devices to determine how close two individuals are.  If one is infected, the chance of infecting the other person is determined by the distance between them.  If two people touch, the chance of infection is much higher than if they remain far apart.

Here are some mock-up screens of what the app would look like.
